This is a Tampermonkey userscript that helps automatically download and organize files from SJTU's Canvas platform.

This project is intended for educational and personal use only. Please respect your institution's policies regarding automation and file access.

## Features

- Automatically downloads all files from a Canvas course page
- Categorizes files into folders based on how they are displayed on the Canvas interface

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
2. Download or open the [`downloader.js`](./downloader.js) file.
3. Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script automatically.
4. Open any Canvas course's Files page (e.g., `https://oc.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/80071/files`) to begin using it.

## Project Status

This is a "vibe coding" project â€” fully generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, including:
- Script logic
- README structure
- Changelog entries

The script is functional and designed to be adaptable, but it is not intended for production use without further review.
