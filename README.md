# Sjtu-Canvas-Download-Script

**This is a vibe coding project for entertaining purpose. All source code, including the userscript, README, and changelog, was fully generated by ChatGPT in collaboration with the user.**

**This is not a desktop application or synchronization tool. It is a lightweight Tampermonkey userscript that runs entirely in the browser.**

## Overview

**Sjtu-Canvas-Download-Script** is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to automate downloading and organizing course files from the SJTU Canvas platform.

It provides a simple and browser-native solution for managing course resources, without requiring any installation beyond the Tampermonkey browser extension.

This project is for personal and educational use. Users are expected to comply with institutional policies regarding file access and automation.

- Provides an interface to view downloaded files and clear records
- Supports handling multiple courses through their unique course code

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
2. Download or open the [`downloader.js`](./sjtu-canvas-download-script.user.js) file.
3. Tampermonkey will prompt you to review and install the script.
4. Navigate to the **Files** page of any SJTU Canvas course, for example:

## Usage Notes

- This script is intended to be used only on Canvas pages that match the SJTU domain.
- Folder categorization is based on the way files are displayed within the Canvas interface.
- Previously downloaded files are tracked locally and will not be downloaded again unless the record is cleared.

All logic is encapsulated in a single userscript, with no dependencies or back-end services.
